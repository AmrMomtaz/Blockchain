# Blockchain

Assignments from the Coursera course <b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a></b>.<br>
In this assignment I've implemented a node thatâ€™s part of a block-chain-based distributed consensus protocol.<br>
Specifically, the code will receive incoming transactions and blocks and maintain an updated block chain.<br>
You can refer to the problem statement in the following repository for all the details <a href ="https://github.com/thiennc/Coursera-Blockchain">link</a>.
